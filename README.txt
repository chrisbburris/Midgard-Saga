which was made by a student team at The Guildhall of Southern Methodist University.

This code's purpose is for the portfolio website of Chris Burris, one of the students
who worked on the game.

Chris Burris wrote some of this this code in collaboration with another teammate, Preston Hulcy.
There are comments in the files that specify which parts of the code were written by whom.
